If you want to play the game, download CurseBreaker_Test_Build.zip or CurseBreaker_Game.zip. Uzip the file and run the executable in the folder.

If you want to access the game's code or assets, download CurseBreaker_Project.zip. Unzip the file. The assets and scripts of the games can be accessed without Unity by looking through the folder but it is recommended to open the project in Unity.
